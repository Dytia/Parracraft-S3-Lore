The Bard Has been in the world since The Bannanna Man (Parra's Predescor Wizard) . Before the wizard left the world he granted his faithful bard one wish, The Bard Decided on A 
Safe Haven for his people. The Barrier Or Some call it The Tree Of Saol. Parracite The Wizard Pulls The Bard out of retirement for his help  on a mystical quest to get his powers 
back from Parralt. This goes badly, Parralt trapped parra in a spell then corrupting him, He becomes evil and tries to kill everyone but the bard. (He Likes the bard.)
When that's done and defeated. The Bard goes back into hiding and Meets two lovely Witches Named Hannah and Lily they were sweet but half way through they put an ice spike in one of my
towers... Eventually the tree starts to die for no aparent reason.. We then find out...
